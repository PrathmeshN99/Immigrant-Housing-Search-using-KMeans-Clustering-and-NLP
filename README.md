# Home Hunt
By integrating data scraping from Google for amenities and Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis, the project seeks to offer a holistic solution that optimizes the accommodation search process, enriches the overall immigrant experience, and assists businesses in strategic location decisions.

* Young adults often face difficulties when it comes to immigrating to new cities for pursuing higher studies from colleges or for work purposes. As different people have different interests, finding a suitable place living becomes a challenge​
* The purpose of this project is to create a system to find the best accommodation for the user in a particular city by classifying the user preference based on the parameters​

# Results

The system effectively provided personalized accommodation recommendations based on user preferences, budget, and proximity to essential amenities, thereby addressing a critical need in the immigrant community. Incorporating feedback and user-centric design principles enhanced the overall usability and effectiveness of the system.
Our project presents a comprehensive and data-driven solution to the challenges of guiding students and immigrants to find accommodations near their preferred food outlets. By leveraging web scraping, NLP, and K-Means clustering, we can provide highly personalized recommendations based on user preferences, budget constraints, and proximity to amenities. This approach enhances the user experience, streamlines decision-making, and empowers businesses with valuable location insights. The incorporation of mapping and visualization layers adds a unique dimension, presenting clustered accommodations and nearby amenities on interactive maps for a holistic view. This integrated approach promises to simplify the search process and significantly improve user satisfaction while aiding businesses in strategic decision-making.
